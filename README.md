# Online R&eacute;sum&eacute;

This r&eacute;sum&eacute; is created using JavaScript which combines personal
information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate it.  This
includes manipulating data types (like JSON), building loops and creating
functions, and jQuery DOM manipulation methods which builds the r&eacute;sum&eacute;
the moment a user opens the website.
